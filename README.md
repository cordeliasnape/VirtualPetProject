# Virtual Pet Project

This project was developed as part of the Full Stack MERN Bootcamp at Tech Educators.

We aimed to recreate a digital pet simulation reminiscent of the classic Tamagotchi game, complete with engaging interactions and pet care. It was essential for us to have a unique design for our pets to avoid copyright issues.

Our project consists of three main pages:

- About Page
  - Contains information about the team members and showcases required CSS animations.
- Landing Page
  - Allows users to customize their virtual pets.
- Game Page
  - Hosts the interactive pet simulation.

## My Role

As the project's initial concept creator, I took on a project management role, ensuring smooth coordination among the team. I also oversaw the creative aspect of the project.

I was responsible for creating all the pet designs, which you can view on [my Pixilart Profile](https://www.pixilart.com/cordeliadot/gallery). This creative process involved painstakingly crafting multiple iterations of each pet, resulting in over 40 cat drawings and 16 dog drawings.

Additionally, I wrote the JavaScript code that handles the pet's evolving needs, which you can find in the 'cordtest' folders. While JavaScript wasn't my strongest suit, I dedicated significant effort to make the logic work. My group member, Liam, later refactored and integrated it into the game.

During the final days of the project, I also contributed to the game page's CSS to give it a unique visual style.

## Tech Skills

We used this project as an opportunity to practice our JavaScript skills, applying our learning in a practical context.

## Achievements

Our project received a positive response during the presentation. I take pride in my contributions, especially in the game logic that I developed. While I used ChatGPT for guidance and planning over two days, I independently worked out the game's complex logic. This experience boosted my confidence in JavaScript and allowed me to undertake a personal project, Rock Paper Scissors, the following week.

## Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge I faced was integrating my code into the existing game code while ensuring proper labeling. Managing merge conflicts caused a temporary project delay, but we successfully resolved them. Collaborating with team members, even those I didn't know, presented its own challenges, but we had a conflict resolution plan in place.

## Next Steps

Liam and I have exciting plans for the project's future:

- Adding mini-games for users to enjoy while interacting with their pets.
- Expanding customization options for the game portal, emulating the diversity of classic Tamagotchis.
- Implementing pet care actions such as bathing, grooming, and cleaning.
- Enhancing user interaction by allowing them to pet their virtual pets with their mouse.
- Expanding the selection of virtual pet options to include rabbits, guinea pigs, birds, and more.
- Introducing a currency system and a virtual pet shop for users to purchase items, with whimsical touches like a cat pushing a shopping cart in the background.
